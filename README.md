## Life isn't fair

Sometimes, we all think that we're in-charge of our own destines, lives, and that we have figured out everything. 

But life doesn't always go this way. Sometimes we are at the top of the world and it only takes a few moments to fall down to ground. When this happens you must have the courage to stand back up and climb again to reach the top.

## Create your own story

If you think about it, each day in your life is like an adventure. Each day is a story in it self. But the thing about these stories is that you can't choose them, they choose you.

The story of your life is the sum of all that has happened to you in real life. If your story is not a story that can be told then you haven't lived life.

## Flow state

The flow state is the state when you are in your MAX productivity mode. Finding this flow state is critical for being productive and staying a top of your goals. But the thing about the flow state is that it's really hard to find.

Each person has a different setting or "environment variables" that trigger their flow state. You have to go on a journey to find your own flow state and then master it to be more productive and live a fulfilling life.

### You're not an imposter

Imposter syndrome is the feeling you get when you know how to do a certain task but think that you're not good enough for it or that you'll screw up. This feeling will only affect you until you keep thinking about doing something.

Once you start doing it and enter your flow state it will be powerless against you.

## Starting small

A big success is the result of thousands of failures. If you think that a million-dollar company can be created in a day or week then you're clearly wrong and delusional.

Take a giant problem that you or someone else has, break it down into smaller problems and then fix them one by one. By the time you fix the last small problem you'll have fixed the giant problem and that will be a huge success for you.

## You are unique

Creative people are different from other and they are never satisfied because they are always looking for something new and exciting to do.

They are always lost in their own thoughts and are constantly thinking because the normal life is too boring for them.

## Limit your thoughts

Try to limit your thoughts to the things that matter the most to you. Don't get distracted by the outside world or what is happening in the world, This way you'll lose focus over your work and sometimes even forget what you were working on.

Try to be in solitude as often as you can. Walk, stop using your phone, Only handle work related queries during your working hours.

## Your competition

You are your only competition, Each day wake up and try to be a better version of yourself than you were yesterday. 

Don't compete with other people because their lives are different from you and you should only focus on improving yourself.
